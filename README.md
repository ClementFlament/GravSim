# 2D Gravitational Simulation
This project simulates the gravitational interactions between planets in a 2D space using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. It calculates forces, accelerations, and updates positions of planets iteratively over time.

## Features
- Simulate gravitational forces between multiple planets.
- Real-time coordinate updates with adjustable iterations.
- Randomized initial positions and masses for planets.
- Modular code structure for better maintainability.
- Display outputs in the terminal.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language: Core logic implementation.
- Standard Libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, math.h, time.h.

## Installation
### Dependencies
Ensure you have the following:

- A C compiler (e.g., gcc).
