# 3D Gravitational Simulation
This project simulates the gravitational interactions between planets in a 3D space using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. It calculates forces, accelerations, and updates positions of planets iteratively over time.

## Features
- Simulate gravitational forces between multiple planets.
- Real-time coordinate updates with adjustable iterations.
- Randomized initial positions and masses for planets.
- Stars implementation.
- Modular code structure for better maintainability.
- Display prompt and outputs in GUI.
- Threads to parallel the calculation and reduce the time of processing.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language: Core logic implementation.
- Standard Libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, math.h, time.h.
- Raylib : GUI and graphical representation.
- Pthread : Parallel calculations.
